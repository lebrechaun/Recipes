# Recipes
This project is a list of my favourite recipes that I have made! I'll be 
making a basic HTML website employing skills learnt including:
 - filling in boilerplate
 - title, headings, body and paragraphing
 - strong and emphasis usage
 - links to secondary pages
 - image usage
 - ordered and unordered lists

Enjoy the website and try out one of the recipes! Caio!
