        <p><h3>Story</h3></p>
            <p>
            I was introduced to this cut of meat a few years ago by a Brazilian friend. Once I tried it for myself, I was 
            blown away by the incredibe flavor and from then on, this became my favourite cut of meat to BBQ...no...my 
            favourite cut of meat. Period. The juices from the fat cap run into the meat, giving it a succulent, tender 
            flavour filled experience! But whats amazing is it's so simple! So let me give you the recipe so you can cook for others!
